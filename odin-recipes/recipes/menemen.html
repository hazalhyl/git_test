    <p>This traditional Turkish egg scramble is quick and easy to make with a few basic ingredients, and extra-delicious when served up with some good crusty bread.  See notes above for possible variations.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients
        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>1 small white onion, finely diced</li>
            <li>1 large green bell pepper*, diced</li>
            <li>1 (15-ounce) can diced tomatoes, with their juices</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon Aleppo pepper*</li>
            <li>fine sea salt and freshly-cracked black pepper</li>
            <li>3 or 4 eggs</li>
            <li>optional garnishes: sliced chives or chopped parsley, crumbled feta, sliced avocado</li>
        </ul>
        Steps:
        <ol>
            <li>Sauté the veggies: Sauté some finely-diced onion and peppers in olive oil until softened</li>
            <li>Add tomatoes and seasonings: Add in the tomatoes, butter, Aleppo pepper, plus a generous pinch of salt and black pepper, and stir for a bit until the tomatoes are nice and hot.</li>
            <li>Add the eggs: Crack the eggs directly onto the tomato mixture and let them cook for about a minute or so. Then use a spoon to break up the yolks and briefly stir the eggs into the tomato mixture. (I recommend only partially stirring in the eggs, so that they are nice and swirly on top.)  Continue cooking until the eggs reach your desired level of doneness. Traditionally the eggs are cooked until just barely set, yet still soft, about 3 to 4 minutes total.</li>
            <li>Serve immediately with your desired garnishes, along with a few slices of toasted bread to scoop up the menemen, and dive in!</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Possible Variations:
            <ul>
                <li>Add garlic and/or extra herbs: We were told that garlic is also sometimes used in menemen, which I think would be delicious sautéed in with the onions. Feel free to also add in a pinch of dried oregano if you would like, and/or top the menemen with chopped fresh parsley.</li>
                <li>Add cheese: Many of the places we visited in Istanbul also offered menemen options with different kinds of local cheeses. The version I loved best used a cheese similar to feta, which was stirred in with the eggs at the end of the recipe.</li>
                <li>Add sausage: There was also a popular version made with sausage, which you could sauté in with the onions at the beginning of the recipe.</li>
                <li>Use fresh tomatoes: As mentioned above, feel free to use fresh tomatoes instead of canned if they happen to be in season! You would need 1 pound of fresh tomatoes, grated or finely diced, in place of 1 can.</li>
            </ul>
