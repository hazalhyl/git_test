   <p>These make-ahead mashed-potatoes can be made several days ahead and stored in the fridge.</p>
   <h3>Ingredients:

        <li>5 potatoes, cubed</li>
        <li>225 grams of sour cream</li>
        <li>85 grams of cream cheese</li>
        <li>Â½ cup milk</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons onion salt</li>
        <li>ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    Steps:

        <li>Transfer potatoes into a large bowl and mash. Stir in sour cream, cream cheese, milk, onion salt, and pepper until well combined. Transfer into a large casserole dish. </li>
        <li>Let potatoes cool completely, 15 to 20 minutes. Cover with aluminum foil and refrigerate for up to 2 days. </li>
        <li>When ready to bake, remove casserole from the refrigerator and let sit for 30 minutes on the counter. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). </li>
        <li>Bake, covered, in the preheated oven for 50 minutes. </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Tips:
        If you plan on serving these right away, preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C) before you start cooking the potatoes in Step 1. Then follow Steps 1, 2, and 5. </p>
