        <p>Tips:
            <li>Let your leftover French toast cool completely, then place it in an airtight container (such as a zip-top bag or a reusable storage container). Store it in the fridge for about one to three days. </li>
            <li>Yes, you can freeze a big-batch of French toast for up to three months. Arrange the slices in a single layer on a baking sheet, freeze for at least four hours or up to overnight, then store frozen French toast in a freezer-safe container for two to three months. When you're ready to eat it, just throw it on a baking sheet and bake at 375°F until hot and cooked through, about 8-12 minutes. </li>
